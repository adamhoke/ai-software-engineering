### Phase Task:

For the base assets generated by Django and python we will run through a series of prerequisites steps. This is where expert-level knowledge comes in, however if we didn’t know how to do this we could ask Bing using the PQD pattern:

### LLM Tool:

Bing Chat. We would rather have internet accessto fetch the latest instructions for setting up a git repo and starting a Django application. The advanced reasoning of ChatGPT-4 is probably overkill.

### Prompt Pattern:

PQD pattern. Even though this isn't code, this is very technical and will probably have instructions in some parts written in code.

### Exact Input:

```You are an expert python programmer and are teaching a tutorial on python. You are working on a Django web application with a Postgres backend, as well as git and virtualenv.

Show me the steps to create a github repo, clone it, create and start a virtualenv inside the base repo, create and start a basic Django project called “todo_project”, as well as set up a postgres database backend for it.

Comment each step of the process thoroughly. All of the instructions should be tailored for a Debian based Linux system Provide a few different solutions and explain the rational behind each.
```

NOTE: you don’t have to use a Debian based Linux system, that’s just what I’m using as my development environment.

### Output:

```
Certainly! Let's go through the steps:

### 1. Create a GitHub Repository

1. Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/).

2. Login with your credentials.

3. Click on the '+' icon on the top right corner and choose 'New repository'.

4. Name your repository (e.g., "django-todo-app") and choose other settings based on your preference.

5. Click 'Create repository'.

### 2. Clone the Repository

On your Debian based system, use the following commands:
```

```bash

# Navigate to the directory where you want to place your project

cd path/to/directory

# Clone the GitHub repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/django-todo-app.git

cd django-todo-app

```

```
### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

There are a few methods to set up virtual environments in Python. Here are two common ones:

#### Using `venv` (bundled with Python):
```


```bash

# Install venv if not installed

sudo apt-get install python3-venv

# Create a new virtual environment

python3 -m venv venv_name

# Activate the virtual environment

source venv_name/bin/activate

```

```
#### Using `virtualenv`:
```


```bash

# Install virtualenv

pip install virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment

virtualenv venv_name

# Activate the virtual environment

source venv_name/bin/activate

```

```
**Rationale**: `venv` comes bundled with Python3. However, `virtualenv` can offer more functionality and can create environments for arbitrarily installed python versions.

### 4. Start a Django Project

First, install Django:
```

```bash

pip install django

```

```
Now, create the Django project:
```

```bash

django-admin startproject todo_project .

```

```
### 5. Set Up Postgres Backend

#### Install PostgreSQL and psycopg2
```

```bash

# Install PostgreSQL

sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib

# Install psycopg2 (Python adapter for PostgreSQL)

pip install psycopg2-binary

```

```
#### Set Up a New PostgreSQL Database and User
```

```bash

# Access PostgreSQL command line as superuser

sudo -u postgres psql

# Create database

CREATE DATABASE tododb;

# Create user with password

CREATE USER todouser WITH PASSWORD 'password_here';

# Set default encoding, tsearch2 (for full-text search) and timezone

ALTER ROLE todouser SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';

ALTER ROLE todouser SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';

ALTER ROLE todouser SET timezone TO 'UTC';

# Grant all privileges on the database to the user

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE tododb TO todouser;

# Exit PostgreSQL command line

\q

```

```
#### Update Django Settings for PostgreSQL Backend

Navigate to `todo_project/settings.py` and make the following changes:
```

```python

DATABASES = {

'default': {

'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',

'NAME': 'tododb',

'USER': 'todouser',

'PASSWORD': 'password_here',

'HOST': 'localhost',

'PORT': '5432',

}

}

```

```
### Final Thoughts

Remember to make regular commits to your GitHub repository:
```

```bash

# Add all changes

git add .

# Commit the changes

git commit -m "Your commit message here"

# Push the changes to GitHub

git push origin master

```

```
**Rationale**: Breaking down your work into regular commits helps to keep track of changes and makes it easier to revert or reference previous states of the code.

Hope this helps you get started!
```

### Usage Result:

These are good instructions, though we didn't end up using the sql code because we launch the postgres server application through a container and set that information as environment variables that are used to initalize the user / password on container start.However, for reference we added it to a file called `database_setup.sql`
