### Phase Task:
A Kubernetes manifest is a YAML or JSON file that defines how an application or service should be deployed and managed within a Kubernetes cluster. It specifies various Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, deployments, and more, detailing their desired states, configurations, and interrelationships.

### LLM Tool:
Since we’re writing YAML that is essentially code, we’re going to use Code Interpreter.

### Prompt Pattern:
The PQD pattern

### Exact Input:
```
You are an expert python programmer, software engineer, and devops engineer. You are working on containerizing a small simple application that can be deployed anywhere Kubernetes runs.

Here is the online location of the repository code:
https://github.com/adamhoke/ai-software-engineering

Please create all the manifests required to deploy this application to Kubernetes. It is a python web application and has a Postgres database backend. Look at the docker compose yaml files in the repository for reference. The application has the minimum requirements:

- Fast enough and scalable enough to support 10 users at a time
- Restart on crash
- Be web accessible
- Store secrets in configuration secrets
- Store environment variables in configMaps
- Have storage volumes for files
- Anything necessary to also host a postgres database

Please create the manifests files in .yaml format. Please document each line clearly. Please create them in a way that they are agnostic to any specific hosting provider.
```

### Exact Output:
```
Creating Kubernetes manifests for deploying a Python web application with a PostgreSQL database involves several steps. Since I can't access external URLs like GitHub, I'll provide a general guide and example YAML files based on common practices.

1. Namespace
First, create a namespace to logically isolate your application within the Kubernetes cluster.
```

```yaml
# namespace.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: myapp-namespace
```

```
2. ConfigMap
ConfigMaps are used to store non-confidential data in key-value pairs. This can include environment variables.
```

```yaml
# configmap.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: myapp-config
  namespace: myapp-namespace
data:
  APP_SETTING: "some-value" # Replace with actual environment variables
```

```
3. Secret
Secrets are used to store sensitive information, such as database passwords.
```

```yaml
# secret.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: myapp-secret
  namespace: myapp-namespace
type: Opaque
data:
  DATABASE_PASSWORD: <base64-encoded-password> # Use base64 to encode your real password
```

```
4. Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim
Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are used for managing storage in Kubernetes.
```

```yaml
# persistentvolumeclaim.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: postgres-pvc
  namespace: myapp-namespace
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi # Adjust size as needed
```

```
5. Deployment for the Python Application
Deployments manage the creation and scaling of pods.
```

```yaml
# app-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
  namespace: myapp-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 2 # Adjust based on your scaling needs
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: <your-python-app-image> # Replace with your Docker image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80 # Adjust if your app uses a different port
        envFrom:
        - configMapRef:
            name: myapp-config
        - secretRef:
            name: myapp-secret
```

```
6. Deployment for PostgreSQL
Similarly, create a deployment for PostgreSQL.
```

```yaml
# postgres-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: postgres-deployment
  namespace: myapp-namespace
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: postgres
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: postgres
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: postgres
        image: postgres:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5432
        envFrom:
        - secretRef:
            name: myapp-secret
        volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data
          name: postgres-storage
      volumes:
      - name: postgres-storage
        persistentVolumeClaim:
          claimName: postgres-pvc
```

```
7. Service
Services are used to expose applications running on a set of Pods.
```

```yaml
# app-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
  namespace: myapp-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80 # Adjust if your app uses a different port
  type: LoadBalancer # Use LoadBalancer for cloud environments or NodePort for on-premises
```

```
8. Ingress (Optional)
If you need to expose your service outside of your cluster, you can use an Ingress. This is optional and depends on your environment.
```

```yaml
# ingress.yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: myapp-ingress
  namespace: myapp-namespace
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: myapp-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

```
Deployment Steps
1. Apply the namespace: kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
2. Apply the ConfigMap and Secret: kubectl apply -f configmap.yaml -f secret.yaml
3. Apply the PersistentVolumeClaim: kubectl apply -f persistentvolumeclaim.yaml
4. Deploy the application and database: kubectl apply -f app-deployment.yaml -f postgres-deployment.yaml
5. Expose the application: kubectl apply -f app-service.yaml
(Optional) Apply the Ingress: kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml

Notes:
- Replace placeholders like <your-python-app-image> and <base64-encoded-password> with your actual data.
- Adjust resource requests and limits based on your application's needs.
- The number of replicas in the deployment can be adjusted for scalability.
- Ensure your Kubernetes cluster supports the LoadBalancer service type; otherwise, use NodePort.
- The Ingress configuration might vary based on your cloud provider or Ingress controller.

This setup should provide a good starting point for deploying your Python web application with a PostgreSQL backend on Kubernetes.
```

### Usage Result:
As you can see, everythinig needed to deploy the basic app to a local Kubernetes cluster was created, although the namespace holders `my-app` and a few other values needed to be changed. Overall the process worked. For Kubernetes there is also a command line tool called `kubectl` that will allow you to generate thee types of files for an entire deployment and service with a few commands. Another possibility would have been to ask the LLM to generate the `kubectl` commands to generate all of these files, then manually modify them as we had to do here.


### Files:
Everything in the `\manifests` folder.
