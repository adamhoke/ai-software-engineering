### Phase Task:
We need to determine the best place and way to deploy a small containerized application such as ours. The best way to figure this out would be to use an internet enable tool such as Google Bard, combined with the best pattern for research. In this case, since we donâ€™t have many technical constraints other than little-to-no cost and a small application, we will stick with the persona pattern:

### LLM Tool:
Google Bard

### Prompt Pattern:
Persona Pattern

### Exact Input:
```
Act as a professional software and devops engineer. You have a very small containerized Django application you would like to deploy to a production environment. Show me all best options to do this. This must be free or very little cost. Once deployed the application must be internet accessible. Ask me any questions to get information you need for your research.
```

### Exact Output:
```
Sure, here are a few options for deploying a small containerized Django application to a production environment:

**Option 1: Deploy to a cloud platform**

Both Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer free tiers that include enough compute resources to run a small Django application. These platforms also provide a variety of tools and services that can make it easy to deploy and manage your application, such as container orchestration services like Kubernetes and serverless computing platforms like Google Cloud Run and AWS Lambda.

To deploy your application to GCP or AWS, you will need to create an account and follow their documentation for deploying containerized applications. This will typically involve creating a cloud instance, installing Docker, and then running your container image on the instance.

**Option 2: Deploy to a free hosting provider**

There are a number of free hosting providers that offer limited resources for hosting containerized applications. These providers typically have restrictions on the amount of CPU, memory, and storage that you can use, but they can be a good option for small applications that don't have a lot of traffic.

Some popular free hosting providers for containerized applications include:

* Heroku
* Glitch
* Render

To deploy your application to a free hosting provider, you will need to create an account and follow their documentation for deploying containerized applications. This will typically involve creating a new application, pushing your container image to their registry, and then starting the application.

**Option 3: Deploy to a Raspberry Pi**

If you have a Raspberry Pi, you can use it as a low-cost server for your Django application. This option is a good choice if you want more control over your infrastructure and don't mind managing the server yourself.

To deploy your application to a Raspberry Pi, you will need to install Docker on the Raspberry Pi and then run your container image on the device. You will also need to configure port forwarding so that your application is accessible from the internet.

**Option 4: Deploy to a home server**

If you have a home server, you can use it as a server for your Django application. This option is similar to deploying to a Raspberry Pi, but it may offer more resources and flexibility.

To deploy your application to a home server, you will need to install Docker on the server and then run your container image on the device. You will also need to configure port forwarding so that your application is accessible from the internet.

**Which option is best for you?**

The best option for you will depend on your specific needs and requirements. If you need a scalable and reliable solution, then deploying your application to a cloud platform like GCP or AWS is a good option. If you are on a tight budget, then deploying your application to a free hosting provider or a Raspberry Pi is a good option. If you want more control over your infrastructure, then deploying your application to a home server is a good option.

**Additional considerations**

No matter which option you choose, there are a few additional things to consider when deploying a Django application to production:

* **Security:** You will need to take steps to secure your application, such as using a firewall and HTTPS.
* **Monitoring:** You will need to monitor your application to make sure it is running smoothly and to identify any problems that may arise.
* **Backups:** You will need to back up your application regularly to prevent data loss.

I hope this information is helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
```

### Usage Result:
For this solution we will deploy to Kubernetes. To save money we will deploy locally on a single-node cluster hosted on a VirtualBox VM using minikube.
