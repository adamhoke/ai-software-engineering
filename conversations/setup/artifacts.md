### Phase Task:

A Visual Studio Code (VSCode) settings file is a configuration file that allows users to customize and configure the behavior and appearance of the VSCode editor.

### LLM Tool:

ChatGPT-4 Code Interpreter, since these settings are basically code.

### Prompt Pattern:

We will try PQD, since these settings are conofiguration for code.


### Exact Input:

```
You are an expert python programmer. You are working on a Django web application with a Postgres backend. You are going to use VSCode as an IDE. You are going to use Flake8 as your linter and Black as your formatter.

Please build a settings.json file that uses these.

Comment each line of code. Include common flake8 and black plugins. Provide a few different solutions and explain the rational behind each.
```

### Exact Output:

```
Certainly! Here's a settings.json file for VSCode that configures it for Django development with a Postgres backend, while integrating Flake8 as the linter and Black as the formatter.

Solution 1: Basic Setup
```

```json
{

// Use the Python extension provided by Microsoft for Python development.

"python.pythonPath": "path_to_your_virtualenv", // Specify the path to your virtual environment.

// Use Flake8 for linting Python code.

"python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,

// Use Black for formatting Python code.

"python.formatting.provider": "black",

"python.formatting.blackPath": "path_to_black_executable", // If not in PATH, specify the path to the Black executable.

// Django template support (syntax highlighting and IntelliSense).

"files.associations": {

"**/templates/*.html": "django-html",

"**/templates/*": "django-txt",

"**/requirements{/**,*}.{txt,in}": "pip-requirements"

}

}
```

```

Solution 2: Extended Setup with Flake8 and Black Plugins
```

```json

{

// Basic Python and Django setup.

"python.pythonPath": "path_to_your_virtualenv",

"python.linting.flake8Enabled": true,

"python.formatting.provider": "black",

"python.formatting.blackPath": "path_to_black_executable",

"files.associations": {

"**/templates/*.html": "django-html",

"**/templates/*": "django-txt",

"**/requirements{/**,*}.{txt,in}": "pip-requirements"

},

// Additional Flake8 configurations, including some common plugins.

"python.linting.flake8Args": [

"--max-line-length=88", // Matches Black's default line length.

"--select=E,W,F", // Only show errors, warnings, and flake8-flask warnings.

"--ignore=E501,W503", // Commonly ignored Flake8 rules.

"--docstring-convention=google" // Use Google's docstring formatting convention.

],

"python.linting.flake8Plugins": ["flake8-bandit", "flake8-bugbear", "flake8-import-order"],

// Additional Black configurations.

"python.formatting.blackArgs": ["--line-length", "88"], // Matches Black's default line length.

"editor.formatOnSave": true // Automatically format the document upon saving.

}
```

```

Rationale:

Solution 1 provides a basic setup that gets a developer started with Django, Flake8, and Black. It's minimalistic and doesn't include any custom configurations or plugins.

Solution 2 is an extended setup. It includes common plugins for Flake8 like flake8-bandit for security checks, flake8-bugbear for additional lint checks, and flake8-import-order for import order checks. The configuration for Flake8 is adjusted to match Black's default line length of 88 characters. Additionally, files are automatically formatted with Black upon saving.

Adjust the paths (path_to_your_virtualenv and path_to_black_executable) to match your actual paths. The configurations provided should help ensure consistency in code quality and style across a team.
```

### Usage Result:

This code would be placed inside a `settings.json` file inside of a `.vscode` directory in a project. It would affect the interaction wiht the ide along with the flake8 and black formatter settings.

### Phase Task:

A ``.flake8` configuration file is used to define and customize rules for the flake8 tool, which checks Python code for compliance with PEP 8 and other coding standards. In the context of a `pyproject.toml` file, the Black formatter configuration specifies rules and preferences for automatically formatting Python code to adhere to the Black code style.

### LLM Tool:

ChatGPT-4 Code Interpreter, since these are basically code.

### Prompt Pattern:

PQD, for writing new code configuration.

### Exact Input:

```
You are an expert python programmer. You are working on a Django web application with a Postgres backend. You have already made a settings.json file that incorporates settings for Flake8 linter and Black formatter.

You will now write 2 files: the .flake8 configuration file for the Flake8 settings and the pyproject.toml file for the Black settings.

Comment each line of code. Use the supplied settings.json file to help you with configuration settings. Make sure you follow modern python and PEP-8 standards. Follow Google python docstring style. Provide a few different solutions and explain the rational behind each. Here is the settings.json file you will work from:

(Paste settings.json file from previous exercise here.)
```

### Exact Output:

```
Alright! Let's start by extracting the relevant information from the settings.json file and create the .flake8 and pyproject.toml files.


.flake8 Configuration File

We can create the .flake8 configuration file using the "python.linting.flake8Args" and "python.linting.flake8Plugins" sections of the settings.json.
```

```flake8
# .flake8

# Set the maximum allowed line length to 88 characters.

# This matches the default line length used by Black.

max-line-length = 88

# Select which errors, warnings, and flake8-flask warnings to show.

select = E,W,F

# Ignore certain common Flake8 rules.

ignore = E501,W503

# Use Google's docstring formatting convention.

docstring-convention = google

# Plugins to use with Flake8.

# These plugins provide additional checks for potential vulnerabilities (bandit),

# common bugs (bugbear), and import ordering (import-order).

plugins =

flake8-bandit,

flake8-bugbear,

flake8-import-order
```

```
pyproject.toml Configuration File

We can set up the pyproject.toml file using the "python.formatting.blackArgs" section from the settings.json.
```

```toml
# pyproject.toml

# Configure Black - The Uncompromising Code Formatter.

[tool.black]

# Set the maximum line length to 88 characters.

# This matches the default line length used by both Black and our Flake8 configuration.

line-length = 88

# Automatically format the document upon saving.

format-on-save = true
```

```
Rationale:

.flake8: This configuration file is for Flake8, which is a linter for Python. It checks your Python code against some style guide. The options set here are mainly based on the given settings.json and make sure the linting is in sync with Black, our formatter.

pyproject.toml: This configuration file is for Black, which is a code formatter. The settings we used make sure the code is formatted to a consistent style. The pyproject.toml format is a newer standard for configuration in the Python ecosystem and is widely adopted by modern Python tools.

Using both a linter (Flake8) and a formatter (Black) helps to ensure that the code is not only syntactically correct but also follows a consistent style, making it easier to read and maintain.
```

### Usage Result:

The code for the flak8 file would be placed in he root directory of the project in a `.flake8` file that would be automatically picked up by the IDE. The black file settings would be placed in a pyproject.toml file at the root of the project directory, and likewise be picked up automatically by the IDE.

### Files:
`.flake8` & `pyproject.toml`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Phase Task:

Python virtualenv is a tool used to create isolated Python environments, ensuring that a project has its own set of dependencies and won't conflict with system-wide libraries. A bash script to activate a virtual environment in the current directory and install dependencies in one command would be nice.

### LLM Tool:

This is code so ChatGPT-4 Code Interpreter.

### Prompt Pattern:

No Pattern even needed. Actually, even asking about that subject would generate a bash script. Since Bash scripts arenâ€™t very logically complex (usually), they are the easiest programmatic thing you can ask an LLM to do. 

### Exact Input:

Write a bash script that would activate a virtual environment in the current directory and install dependencies from a requirements.txt file

### Exact Output:

```source ./venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt.```

### Usage Result:

This will be placed in a script and the permissions set to executable using `$ chmod +x`. Using AI-powered LLM tools to quickly generate Bash scripts for redundant tasks is an absolute no-brainer for any engineer.

### File:

`activate.sh`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Phase Task:

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a configuration file, usually named `docker-compose.yml`, to define and configure the application's services. This setup simplifies local development by allowing developers to run multiple service containers related to their application without installing the services directly on their machines; furthermore, the containers can later be re-deployed to container platforms like Kubernetes or Amazon ECS for production.

### LLM Tool:

Since YAML _is_ code, we will use ChatGPT-4 Code Interpreter.

### Prompt Pattern:

PQD Pattern for code.

### Exact Input:

```
You are an expert full-stack software engineer who knows containerization well. You are working on a Django web application with a Postgres backend. With this application you are also going to use PGAdmin for interfacing with the database.

Create a Docker Compose YAML file with the following specifications:
- Use version 3.8.
- Define three services: todo, db, and pgadmin.
- The todo service:
  - Build from the current directory with a Dockerfile named Dockerfile.
  - Mount the current directory to /app in the container.
  - Expose and bind port 8000.
  - Depend on the db service and only start after db is healthy.
  - Use the network todo_net.
  - Have an entrypoint that:
  - Runs Django migrations for an app named todo_app.
  - Creates a Django superuser with username admin, email admin@example.com, and password password.
  - Starts a Django development server on 0.0.0.0:8000.
- The db service:
  - Use the postgres:latest image.
  - Set environment variables for username todouser, password todopassword, and database name tododb.
  - Expose and bind port 5432.
  - Use the network todo_net.
  - Have a health check that tests if the database is ready for connections using the pg_isready command with the previously mentioned username and database name.
- The pgadmin service:
  - Use the dpage/pgadmin4:latest image.
  - Set environment variables for default email admin@todo.com and password adminpassword.
  - Expose and bind port 8080 to 80 in the container.
  - Use the network todo_net.
  - Define a network named todo_net that uses the bridge driver.

Comment each line of code. For the Postgres and PGAdmin services just use publicly available images off of Dockerhub. Provide a few different solutions and explain the rational behind each.
```

### Exact Output:

```
Alright, let's create the docker-compose.yml file as per your specifications. I'll provide you with two solutions and then discuss the rationale behind each.

Solution 1: Using Command-based Entrypoint for the todo service
```

```yaml
# Using version 3.8 of the Docker Compose specification
version: '3.8'

# Define the services to be created
services:

  # Define the todo service
  todo:
    # Build from the current directory using the specified Dockerfile
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    # Mount the current directory to /app inside the container
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    # Expose and bind port 8000
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    # Set the dependency on the db service
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    # Use the specified network
    networks:
      - todo_net
    # Define the entrypoint for the service
    entrypoint: >
      bash -c "python manage.py migrate todo_app &&
               echo \"from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model; User = get_user_model(); User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@example.com', 'password')\" | python manage.py shell &&
               python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"

  # Define the db service
  db:
    # Use the specified image from Dockerhub
    image: postgres:latest
    # Set the required environment variables
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: todouser
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: todopassword
      POSTGRES_DB: tododb
    # Expose and bind port 5432
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    # Use the specified network
    networks:
      - todo_net
    # Define the health check for the service
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U todouser -d tododb"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  # Define the pgadmin service
  pgadmin:
    # Use the specified image from Dockerhub
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    # Set the required environment variables
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: admin@todo.com
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: adminpassword
    # Expose and bind port 8080 to 80 inside the container
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    # Use the specified network
    networks:
      - todo_net

# Define the networks to be used
networks:
  todo_net:
    driver: bridge
```

```
Rationale for Solution 1:
We use a command-based entrypoint for the todo service. This is a straightforward way to define the operations sequentially within the entrypoint using bash.
The depends_on condition ensures that the todo service only starts after the db service is healthy.
The health check for the db service uses the pg_isready command to ensure that the database is ready for connections.
Solution 2: Using a Script-based Entrypoint for the todo service
In this solution, instead of directly using commands in the entrypoint, we'd use a separate script (entrypoint.sh) that contains the operations:

entrypoint.sh:
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run Django migrations for the todo_app
python manage.py migrate todo_app

# Create a Django superuser
echo "from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model; User = get_user_model(); User.objects.create_superuser('admin', 'admin@example.com', 'password')" | python manage.py shell

# Start the Django development server
python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```

```
Make sure to give execute permission to the script using chmod +x entrypoint.sh.

Then, in the docker-compose.yml:
```

```yaml
# ... (same as above)

  # Define the todo service
  todo:
    # ... (same as above)
    # Use the script as the entrypoint
    entrypoint: /app/entrypoint.sh

# ... (rest of the file is the same as above)
```

```
Rationale for Solution 2:
Separating the entrypoint logic into a script makes the docker-compose.yml file cleaner and more readable.
It's easier to manage and modify the script than editing the docker-compose.yml file directly.
This approach is more modular and maintainable in the long run.
Final Thoughts:
Both solutions achieve the desired outcome. Solution 1 is more compact, with everything contained within the docker-compose.yml. Solution 2, however, offers better maintainability and clarity by separating the logic into a dedicated script. Depending on your preferences and project complexity, you can choose the approach that suits you best.
```

### Usage Result:

We ended up using solution #1 since we didn't have to create another file and update the Dockerfile.

### File:

`docker-compose.yaml`

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Phase Task:

Create the Dockerfile that will be used with the compose service "todo" (the other services will use publicly available container images off Dockerhub)

### LLM Tool:

Once again, this is code so we will use ChatGPT-4 Code Interpreter.

### Prompt Pattern:

For code, the PQD pattern.

### Exact Input:

```
You are an expert full-stack software engineer who knows containerization well. You are working on a Django web application with a Postgres backend. With this application you are also going to use PGAdmin for interfacing with the database.

Write a Dockerfile that:
- Uses the official Python 3.8 slim image as the base.
- Sets the environment variable PYTHONUNBUFFERED to 1 for Django.
- Sets the working directory in the container to /app.
- Copies the contents of the current directory into the container's /app directory.
- Installs the Python packages listed in requirements.txt without using the cache."

Comment each line of code. For the Postgres and PGAdmin services just use publicly available images off of Dockerhub. Provide a few different solutions and explain the rational behind each.
```

### Exact Output:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Python runtime as the parent image
FROM python:3.8-slim

# Set environment variables for Django
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

# Create and set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the current directory contents into the container
COPY . /app

# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage Result:

This is the dockerfile used by the "todo" service of docker compose

### File:

`Dockerfile`
