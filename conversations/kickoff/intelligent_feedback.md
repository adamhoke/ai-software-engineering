### Phase Task:

We want to create an application that will help us manage our todo items. We want to ask AI what a good way to accomplish this would be.

### LLM Tool:

Because this is a more complex task that requires higher reasoning but no internet access, ChatGPT-4 would be the best choice of tool.

### Prompt Pattern:

Since weâ€™re coming up with a technology solution to a business use case, the Few Shot pattern would be the best choice.

### Exact Input:

```
Situation: We find we have difficulty managing employee time cards 
Action: We decided to build an application that will help us with this situation 
Think: We have a team of python developers who understand the various web technologies available to python who can build web-applications that satisfy our business needs. 
Result: The developers built a python Django web application to help us manage employee time cards. 
Situation: We need to keep track of out to-do items 
Action: We will meet to discuss what can be done about this 
Think: About our solution last time 
Result:
```

### Exact Output:

```
Result: We decided to leverage our team's expertise in Python and developed a task management web application using Django. This application allows us to categorize, prioritize, and track the progress of each to-do item, ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks and boosting our team's productivity.
```

### Usage Result:

This was a simple scenario. We had a good idea of the tech stack we wanted to use ahead of time and since our team had motivation to use it again, the response was both not suprising and well recieved.
