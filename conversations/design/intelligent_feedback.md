### Phase Task:

We already have the Vision and Scope document, the Project Plan and a Task list breakdown with task estimations. We could use get some intelligent feedback on the technologies and design patterns used. An interesting idea would be to use the template pattern and an internet-enabled LLM such as Google Bard to get the breakdown of technologies weâ€™ll need to familiarize ourselves with.

### LLM Tool:

Google Bard for internet-enabled research.

### Prompt Pattern:

Template Pattern to get our results in a list we can familiarize ourselves with.

### Exact Input:

```
I'm building a to-do list web application. I know I am going to use python, Django framework, and a Postgres database backend. I would like you to create a report for me of the technologies used (including any additional technologies not mentioned), the place I can download them, a link to the official documentation, and some notes on why it's useful for this project. Place it all in a tabular format using this template:
|Technology|Official Site|Documentation Link|Reasoning|
|<Value Here>|<Value Here>|<Value Here>|<Value Here>|

Ask me any questions for information you may need along the way.
```

### Exact Output:

```
Here is a tabular report of the technologies that you can use to build a to-do list web application using Python, Django, and Postgres:
```

| Technology | Official Site | Documentation Link | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python | Python website: https://www.python.org/ | Python documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/ | Python is a general-purpose programming language that is easy to learn and use. It is also very powerful and versatile, making it a good choice for developing web applications. |
| Django | Django website: https://www.djangoproject.com/ | Django documentation: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/ | Django is a Python web framework that makes it easy to develop complex web applications quickly and efficiently. It provides a number of features that are useful for to-do list applications, such as a built-in user authentication system and an admin interface. |
| Postgres | Postgres website: https://www.postgresql.org/ | Postgres documentation: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/ | Postgres is a powerful and reliable open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is a good choice for to-do list applications because it is scalable and can handle a large number of concurrent users. |
| PostgreSQL psycopg2 driver | psycopg2 website: https://www.psycopg.org/ | psycopg2 documentation: https://www.psycopg.org/docs/ | The PostgreSQL psycopg2 driver is a Python library that allows you to interact with Postgres databases. It is a necessary dependency for any Django application that uses Postgres as its backend database. |
| Bootstrap | Bootstrap website: https://getbootstrap.com/ | Bootstrap documentation: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/ | Bootstrap is a front-end CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and mobile-friendly web applications. It is a good choice for to-do list applications because it provides a number of pre-built components and utilities that you can use to create your user interface. |

```
Additional technologies that you may want to consider using include:

* **Celery** - A distributed task queue that can be used to offload long-running tasks from your web application. This can be useful for tasks such as sending emails or generating reports.
* **Redis** - An in-memory data structure store that can be used to cache data and improve the performance of your web application.
* **Sentry** - An error tracking and monitoring service that can help you to identify and fix bugs in your web application.

You can download all of the technologies listed above from their respective websites.

I hope this report is helpful. Please let me know if you have any questions.
