### Phase Task:

Weâ€™ve already created the project plan for this application. Using that, we can get some intelligent feedback on the plan itself.

### LLM Tool:

ChatGPT-4 for harder reasoning

### Prompt Pattern:

Alternative Approaches

### Exact Input:

```
Give me all of the alternative ways I could divide up the development tasks in my Django to-do list project. I will provide you information such as developer resources and you will provide me alternative approaches to dividing up the work into user stories and tasks. Describe how each approach works, and list the pros and cons of each solution. After each solution, ask me if I would like to use that solution (yes/no) before continuing on the the next offered solution. Before starting, ask me enough questions about developers, skill levels, and deadlines to arrive at the best solution. Here is the original project plan:

### Exact Output:

```
To offer alternative solutions for dividing the tasks in your Django to-do list project, I'll first need to ask a few questions to gather the necessary context:

1. **Number of Developers**: How many developers are there in the development team?

2. **Skill Levels**: Can you categorize your developers by skill level (e.g., junior, mid-level, senior)? And if possible, specify the number of developers in each category.

3. **Specializations**: Do any of the developers have specializations? (e.g., Front-end, Back-end, Database, UI/UX Design, Testing)

4. **Known Challenges**: Are there any known challenges or blockers that you anticipate might come up during development?

5. **Stakeholder Availability**: How frequently will key stakeholders be available for check-ins or to provide input?

6. **Revisions and Iterations**: How much room is there for revisions and iterations based on stakeholder feedback or new requirements?

7. **Flexibility**: Is the timeline set in stone, or is there flexibility with the deadlines?

8. **Preferred Approach**: Do you have a preference for more traditional task division based on role, or are you open to more flexible, dynamic methods?

9. **Other Resources**: Apart from developers, do you have other resources like testers, business analysts, or technical writers available?

10. **Past Experience**: Has the team worked on similar Django projects before?

Once I have the answers to these questions, I can provide alternative solutions tailored to your specific scenario.
```

Here were our responses to the questions:

```
Number of developers: 2 full-time, 1 part-time
Skill Levels: 1 full time senior developer, 1 part-time senior developer, 1 full time junior developer
Specializations: All 3 know python, one has previous experience with UI
Known Challenges: None
Stakeholder Availability: Not available at all
Revisions: Little room for revisions
Flexibility: Timeline is mostly set in stone
Preferred Approach: Open to flexible
Other resources: None
Past Experience: Team has worked on similar Django projects before
```

This was the LLM's response to those answers:

Thank you for the detailed information. Given the team composition and constraints, I'll offer a few alternative solutions for dividing the tasks in your Django to-do list project:

### Solution 1: Role-Based Task Division
**Approach**:
1. **Senior Developer (Full-time)**: Takes lead in backend development and complex features.
2. **Senior Developer (Part-time)**: Focuses on UI development, given the experience in UI.
3. **Junior Developer**: Assists with frontend features, bug fixes, and setting up environments.

**Pros**:
- Leverages the strengths and specializations of each developer.
- Ensures the more experienced developers handle the complex parts of the system.

**Cons**:
- Might silo knowledge, leading to potential bottlenecks if one person is unavailable.

**Would you like to use this solution? (yes/no)**

### Solution 2: Feature-Based Task Division
**Approach**:
Divide the sprints into feature-specific responsibilities. 
1. **Senior Developer (Full-time)**: Takes Sprint 2 (Core Features Development) & Sprint 3 (Advanced Features Development).
2. **Senior Developer (Part-time)**: Takes Sprint 1 (Design and Setup) & Sprint 4 (Additional Features and Testing).
3. **Junior Developer**: Assists in all sprints but focuses more on Sprint 5 (Testing, Debugging, and Documentation) & Sprint 6 (Deployment and Feedback).

**Pros**:
- Enables a holistic understanding of a feature as one person is responsible from start to finish.
- Allows for easy tracking of responsibility.

**Cons**:
- Might put too much pressure on individual developers to deliver a complete feature.
- Does not leverage specializations as effectively.

**Would you like to use this solution? (yes/no)**

### Solution 3: Pair Programming
**Approach**:
The junior developer works in tandem with one of the senior developers on tasks. This provides the junior developer with a learning opportunity and ensures quality.
1. **Senior Developer (Full-time) & Junior Developer**: Handle backend tasks together.
2. **Senior Developer (Part-time)**: Manages frontend/UI tasks and collaborates with the junior developer when necessary.

**Pros**:
- Facilitates knowledge transfer.
- Two sets of eyes can spot bugs and design flaws more effectively.

**Cons**:
- Might slow down initial development as time is spent on discussions.
- Could reduce the overall amount of parallel tasks being tackled.

**Would you like to use this solution? (yes/no)**

Please provide feedback on these solutions, and based on your preference, we can delve deeper or continue exploring other approaches.

I like solution 2
```

The LLM's response to our answer:

Great choice! Solution 2 will distribute responsibility for entire features to developers, which can foster a sense of ownership and holistic understanding of their respective sections. Given your choice, here's a refined and more detailed breakdown:

### Feature-Based Task Division:

#### Senior Developer (Full-time):
**Responsibility**: Handle the core functionalities and advanced features of the application.

- **Sprint 2 (Core Features Development)**
  - Task 2.1: Implement the 'Create a new task' feature.
  - Task 2.2: Implement the 'Edit an existing task' feature.
  - Task 2.3: Implement the 'Delete a task' feature.

- **Sprint 3 (Advanced Features Development)**
  - Task 3.1: Implement 'Assign a task to a category or project' feature.
  - Task 3.2: Implement 'View tasks by category or project' feature.
  - Task 3.3: Implement 'Set due dates for tasks' feature.

#### Senior Developer (Part-time):
**Responsibility**: Oversee design, setup, additional features, and initial testing.

- **Sprint 1 (Design and Setup)**
  - Task 1.1: Design mockups for the application.
  - Task 1.2: Set up the Django development environment.
  - Task 1.3: Set up version control (e.g., Git).

- **Sprint 4 (Additional Features and Testing)**
  - Task 4.1: Implement 'Mark tasks as complete' feature.
  - Task 4.2: Start initial testing and debugging.

#### Junior Developer:
**Responsibility**: Support in all sprints, with a focus on testing, debugging, documentation, deployment, and feedback collection.

- **Sprint 5 (Testing, Debugging, and Documentation)**
  - Task 5.1: Complete thorough testing (working in collaboration with the full-time senior developer).
  - Task 5.2: Debug identified issues.
  - Task 5.3: Draft initial documentation and user manuals.

- **Sprint 6 (Deployment and Feedback)**
  - Task 6.1: Assist in deploying the Django application.
  - Task 6.2: Collect user feedback.
  - Task 6.3: Make necessary quick fixes based on feedback.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Briefing**: Ensure that all developers are on board with their responsibilities and that they have a clear understanding of the application's requirements.
2. **Collaboration**: Emphasize the importance of communication among the team, especially since the junior developer will be working across multiple areas.
3. **Checkpoints**: Set up regular check-ins to ensure that everyone is on track and to address any challenges that may arise.
4. **Documentation**: Ensure that all work is well-documented to facilitate smooth handovers between sprints or if any shifts in responsibility occur.

I hope this provides a clear roadmap for your Django To-Do List Application's development. If you need any adjustments or have other questions, please let me know!
