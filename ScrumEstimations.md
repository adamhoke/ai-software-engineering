Here's an estimated point value and length of time for each task, considering the typical complexity and challenges associated with such tasks. Please note that these are hypothetical estimates and can vary based on the specific requirements and other project constraints:

|Sprint #|Task Name|Estimated Scrum Points|Estimated time (in days)|
|-------|-------|-------|-------|
|Sprint 1|Design mockups for the application|3|2|
|Sprint 1|Set up the Django development environment|5|3|
|Sprint 1|Set up version control (e.g., Git)|2|1|
|Sprint 2|Implement the 'Create a new task' feature|5|3|
|Sprint 2|Implement the 'Edit an existing task' feature|5|3|
|Sprint 2|Implement the 'Delete a task' feature|4|2|
|Sprint 3|Implement 'Assign a task to a category or project' feature|5|3|
|Sprint 3|Implement 'View tasks by category or project' feature|4|2|
|Sprint 3|Implement 'Set due dates for tasks' feature|3|2|
|Sprint 4|Implement 'Mark tasks as complete' feature|4|2|
|Sprint 4|Start initial testing and debugging|8|4|
|Sprint 5|Complete thorough testing (collaboration with the full-time senior developer)|8|4|
|Sprint 5|Debug identified issues|7|4|
|Sprint 5|Draft initial documentation and user manuals|4|2|
|Sprint 6|Assist in deploying the Django application|5|3|
|Sprint 6|Collect user feedback|3|2|
|Sprint 6|Make necessary quick fixes based on feedback|6|3|

Please note that these are general estimates, and the actual work required can be more or less based on various factors. Typically, a team would discuss these tasks in a sprint planning meeting to assign more accurate point values based on collective knowledge and experience.
