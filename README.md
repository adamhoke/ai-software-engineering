# AI Augmented Software Engineering

## Introduction

This repository is a case study of AI-Augmented Software Engineering using a Django "To-Do" List application as a working example. 

## Running the Application
To run the application, first start the virtual environment. This can be done from an AI built script:

```
$ source activate.sh
```

This will create a virtual environment, activate the virtual environment, and install project dependencies
